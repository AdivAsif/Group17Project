            WatchWhiz is a user-friendly TV show recommendation web application focused on giving the best results back 
            to the user based on the series they look for. With its glamorous algorithm which uses sets of data to filter 
            the appropriate response, it is guaranteed to return a group of TV programs that users will enjoy. If one is 
            looking to review and rate a series they can do so, showing the rest of the people using the website what is 
            considered highly praised by the public, as well as indicating the official ratings of TMDB. Each person gets 
            their own customizable profile, in which they can change various information about themselves as well as 
            uploading their own profile picture and banner, with a list of their favourite movies on top of that. With 
            all these functionalities in mind, our goal is to give people a simple way to discover their new yet unknown 
            favourite shows.
