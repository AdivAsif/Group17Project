            WatchWhiz is a user-centric TV show recommendation platform designed for those in search of their next
            favourite show. Utilising a sophisticated algorithm based on cosine similarity, we meticulously filter and
            curate an extensive selection of TV shows that are similar to each other, ensuring a highly accurate and
            relevant set of recommendations.

            You can leave reviews and ratings on any TV show, letting our users share their thoughts on various series,
            which we hope will foster a vibrant community of like-minded individuals. We also show two different ratings
            across every show, one from TMDB (The Movie Database), and on our end - this provides a well-rounded perspective
            on the quality and popularity of each show.

            We understand that personalisation is key to an engaging user experience, so everyone can create and
            customise their own profile, showcasing four of their favourite shows. With the ability to modify personal
            information and upload custom profile pictures and banners, users can make their profiles a reflection of
            their inner TV series critic.
